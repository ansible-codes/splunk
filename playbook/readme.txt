Here are some sample queries you can use in Splunk to collect and analyze CPU, memory, disk, and application-related information:

CPU Usage:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> | timechart avg(cpu_usage) by host
This query will give you the average CPU usage over time for a specific host.

Memory (RAM) Usage:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> | timechart avg(mem_used) by host
This query will provide the average memory usage over time for a specific host.

Disk Usage:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> | timechart sum(disk_used) by host
This query will show the total disk usage over time for a specific host.

Applications Running:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> process_name=* | top limit=10 process_name
This query will list the top 10 running applications/processes on a specific host based on the number of occurrences.

Information from Top Command:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> top_command=* | table _time, host, top_command, cpu_percent, mem_percent
This query will retrieve information similar to the top command, showing CPU and memory usage for processes over time.

Ensure to replace <your_index>, <your_sourcetype>, and <your_host> with your actual index name, sourcetype, and host name. Additionally, adjust the field names (cpu_usage, mem_used, disk_used, process_name, top_command, cpu_percent, mem_percent, etc.) according to your data structure.

These sample queries should help you get started with monitoring CPU, memory, disk, applications, and top command information in Splunk. Adjust them as needed based on your specific requirements and data sources.

================================================

To retrieve the information for the last items (applications running and information from the top command), you would typically need to collect data from system logs or other monitoring sources on your Red Hat server. Here are some common logs and sources you can collect data from for these purposes:

Applications Running:

Process information can be obtained from various sources such as system logs (/var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog), application-specific logs, or by directly querying the system using tools like ps or top.
You might need to configure specific monitoring tools or scripts to gather this information and send it to Splunk.
Information from Top Command:

To gather information similar to the top command, you might need to run scripts or commands periodically and collect their output.
You can use Splunk's scripted inputs to execute custom scripts on your Red Hat server and forward the output to Splunk.
Ensure that the output of your custom script includes relevant information such as process names, CPU usage, memory usage, etc.
For example, you could write a script that runs the top command and captures its output. Then, configure a scripted input in Splunk to execute this script at regular intervals and ingest the output as events with a specific sourcetype.

Here's an example of how you might collect top command output using a scripted input:

Write a script (e.g., top_script.sh) on your Red Hat server:
bash
#!/bin/bash
top -b -n 1 | tail -n +8

Make the script executable:
bash
chmod +x top_script.sh

Configure Splunk's inputs.conf to use the script as a scripted input:
[script://./bin/top_script.sh]
interval = 60
sourcetype = your_sourcetype

This configuration instructs Splunk to execute the top_script.sh script every 60 seconds and ingest its output as events with the specified sourcetype.

Adjust the script and configuration according to your specific requirements and environment. Ensure that the permissions and execution environment are set up appropriately for the script to run successfully and send data to Splunk.
