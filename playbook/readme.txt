Here are some sample queries you can use in Splunk to collect and analyze CPU, memory, disk, and application-related information:

CPU Usage:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> | timechart avg(cpu_usage) by host
This query will give you the average CPU usage over time for a specific host.

Memory (RAM) Usage:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> | timechart avg(mem_used) by host
This query will provide the average memory usage over time for a specific host.

Disk Usage:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> | timechart sum(disk_used) by host
This query will show the total disk usage over time for a specific host.

Applications Running:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> process_name=* | top limit=10 process_name
This query will list the top 10 running applications/processes on a specific host based on the number of occurrences.

Information from Top Command:

index=<your_index> sourcetype=<your_sourcetype> host=<your_host> top_command=* | table _time, host, top_command, cpu_percent, mem_percent
This query will retrieve information similar to the top command, showing CPU and memory usage for processes over time.

Ensure to replace <your_index>, <your_sourcetype>, and <your_host> with your actual index name, sourcetype, and host name. Additionally, adjust the field names (cpu_usage, mem_used, disk_used, process_name, top_command, cpu_percent, mem_percent, etc.) according to your data structure.

These sample queries should help you get started with monitoring CPU, memory, disk, applications, and top command information in Splunk. Adjust them as needed based on your specific requirements and data sources.
