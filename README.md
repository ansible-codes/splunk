reating UI screen usage metrics in Splunk involves collecting, ingesting, and visualizing the relevant data in a way that provides insights into how users interact with your UI screens. Here's a high-level step-by-step guide:

Data Collection:

First, ensure that your application or UI framework captures relevant metrics such as screen views, clicks, durations, navigation paths, etc.
Typically, this is done using logging frameworks, analytics SDKs, or custom code that captures and logs user interactions.
Data Forwarding:

Send the logged metrics to Splunk. This can be done in several ways:
Using Splunk Universal Forwarders installed on the servers hosting your application.
Sending logs directly to a Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint from your application.
Storing logs in an intermediary system (e.g., AWS S3, Kafka) and then ingesting them into Splunk.
Data Ingestion:

Set up an appropriate data input in Splunk to ingest the UI metrics. For example, if you're using HEC, set up an HEC token and endpoint. If you're using forwarders, set up appropriate source types and indexes.
Data Parsing:

Ensure that Splunk correctly parses the ingested data. This might involve setting up field extractions, source type configurations, or custom transformations. You'll want to make sure that important metrics (e.g., screen name, user ID, action type) are appropriately parsed and available as fields in Splunk.
Visualization:

Create dashboards or reports in Splunk to visualize the UI screen usage metrics. This could include:
Timecharts showing the number of views per screen over time.
Pie charts or bar graphs showing the most viewed screens.
Tables showing breakdowns of interactions by user or by session.
Geomaps showing user interactions by location if you capture geolocation data.
Sankey diagrams to visualize user navigation paths across screens.
Alerting & Monitoring (Optional):

You might want to set up alerts or monitoring for certain conditions. For example, if there's a sudden drop in screen views, it could indicate a problem that needs attention.
Optimization:

Periodically review the metrics and dashboards to derive insights. Are certain screens not being viewed as much as expected? Is there a pattern in navigation that suggests users are getting lost? Use these insights to optimize your UI.
Maintenance:

Over time, as your application changes, you might add new screens, remove old ones, or change the nature of interactions. Ensure that your logging and Splunk configurations are updated accordingly.
Keep in mind that while Splunk is a powerful tool for log analysis and visualization, the quality and utility of the insights you derive are largely dependent on the quality and comprehensiveness of the data you log. Make sure to capture relevant metrics in a consistent and structured manner to get the most out of your Splunk analysis.

Oracle performance metrics using splunk:

Using Splunk to monitor Oracle Database performance involves gathering and ingesting relevant Oracle logs and performance metrics, then visualizing and analyzing that data in Splunk. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up this monitoring:

Oracle Metrics and Logs:

Identify which Oracle metrics and logs you're interested in. This might include metrics from Oracle's Automatic Workload Repository (AWR), alert logs, listener logs, or any other custom logs or metrics relevant to your Oracle environment.
Data Collection:

Splunk has a technology add-on called Splunk Add-on for Oracle Database, which allows for the collection of data from Oracle databases. Install and configure this add-on.
Alternatively, use database scripts, Oracle tools, or third-party tools to extract required metrics, and then forward this data to Splunk.
Data Forwarding:

If you're not directly collecting data using the Splunk Add-on for Oracle, then you might need to send the data to Splunk.
This can be done using Splunk Universal Forwarders installed on the Oracle server.
If you're extracting data using scripts or tools, you can write the data to log files which are then monitored by Splunk or send the data directly to a Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint.
Data Ingestion:

Ensure that the data is being ingested into Splunk with the appropriate source types and indexes.
Data Parsing:

Splunk should correctly parse the ingested Oracle data. This might involve setting up field extractions, source type configurations, or custom transformations. Make sure that important metrics and log entries are parsed correctly and available as fields in Splunk.
Visualization:

Build Splunk dashboards or reports to visualize Oracle performance metrics:
Timecharts showing metrics like CPU usage, I/O rates, or wait events over time.
Tables with top SQL queries, locked objects, or slow operations.
Alerts for specific conditions, e.g., tablespace running out of space, a high number of slow queries, etc.
Optimization:

Regularly review the metrics and dashboards to derive insights. This will help you in identifying slow-performing queries, optimizing table structures, and managing resources more effectively.
Maintenance:

Ensure that as your Oracle environment evolves (e.g., new tables, changes in configurations), your Splunk setup continues to capture all relevant metrics.
Finally, make sure to respect any licensing considerations. Both Oracle and Splunk have specific licensing terms, and certain activities, like extensive querying of Oracle databases, might impact your Oracle license requirements. Always consult with your organization's licensing agreements to ensure compliance.

==============================================
Creating adjustment metrics in Splunk, like counts, values, and other derived metrics, involves manipulating your ingested data with Splunk's powerful Search Processing Language (SPL).

Below is a general guide to create adjustment metrics in Splunk:

Identify the Data Source:

Before anything, identify the index, source, or sourcetype where your data resides in Splunk.
Base Search:

Start by running a base search to narrow down your dataset to the relevant events or logs you are interested in analyzing.
makefile
Copy code
index="your_index" sourcetype="your_sourcetype"
Count Adjustments:

To count the number of events or occurrences:

Copy code
| stats count
If you wish to count by a specific field:

csharp
Copy code
| stats count by fieldname
Value Adjustments:

To sum values of a particular field:

python
Copy code
| stats sum(fieldname) as TotalValue
To get the average:

scss
Copy code
| stats avg(fieldname) as AverageValue
For other mathematical operations:

java
Copy code
| eval adjusted_value = fieldname * 0.9  // This multiplies the field value by 0.9
Filtering and Adjustments:

You can also filter your data before or after adjustments:

sql
Copy code
| search fieldname>1000
Combining Metrics:

You can combine various metrics in a single search:

scss
Copy code
| stats count, sum(fieldname) as TotalValue, avg(fieldname) as AverageValue
Time-based Adjustments:

If you want your metrics to be split over time:

python
Copy code
| timechart count, sum(fieldname) as TotalValue
Conditional Adjustments:

If you need to make adjustments based on conditions:

bash
Copy code
| eval adjusted_field = if(fieldname > 100, "High", "Low")
Visualization:

Once you've created the metrics, you can visualize them using Splunk's built-in visualization tools like tables, charts, or graphs.
Save and Share:

Save your search as a report, add it to a dashboard, or set up alerts based on your adjusted metrics.
Remember, these are just starting points, and the beauty of Splunk is in its flexibility. Depending on your dataset and requirements, you might need to adjust these searches or combine multiple commands to get the desired metrics. As always, refer to Splunk's extensive documentation and community for more specific use cases and SPL commands.
