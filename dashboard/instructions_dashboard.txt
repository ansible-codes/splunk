Creating dashboards in Splunk Enterprise to monitor Linux systems involves collecting data from the Linux hosts using Splunk's Universal Forwarder, parsing that data, and then visualizing it on dashboards. Here's a basic outline of steps you'd follow:

Install Splunk Universal Forwarder on your Linux hosts:
Download the appropriate version for Red Hat 7 and Red Hat 9 from the Splunk website.
Install and configure the forwarder to send data to your Splunk Enterprise instance.
Configure Inputs:
Configure inputs on Splunk Universal Forwarder to monitor system logs, performance metrics, etc., and send them to Splunk.
Create Searches and Queries:
Create searches and queries in Splunk's search language (SPL) to extract relevant data from the logs and indexes.
Create Dashboards:
Use Splunk's dashboard editor to create visualizations and panels to represent the data.
Here's a basic example of the code you might use:

Inputs.conf (on the forwarder):
ini
Copy code
[monitor:///var/log/messages]
sourcetype = syslog

[monitor:///var/log/secure]
sourcetype = secure

[monitor:///var/log/httpd/access_log]
sourcetype = access_combined
Props.conf (on the indexer):
ini
Copy code
[source::.../messages]
TRANSFORMS-set = setnull, setparsing, sethosts

[source::.../secure]
TRANSFORMS-set = setnull, setparsing, sethosts

[source::.../access_log]
TRANSFORMS-set = setnull, setparsing, sethosts

[setnull]
REGEX = .
DEST_KEY = queue
FORMAT = nullQueue

[setparsing]
REGEX = .
DEST_KEY = _MetaData:Index
FORMAT = default

[sethosts]
REGEX = .
DEST_KEY = MetaData:Sourcetype
FORMAT = host::RedHat7 or host::RedHat9
Searches and Queries:
spl
Copy code
index=main sourcetype=syslog OR sourcetype=secure OR sourcetype=access_combined
| stats count by host, sourcetype
Dashboard Panels:
Line chart showing system resource usage over time.
Pie chart showing distribution of log events by severity.
Table showing top processes by CPU or memory usage.
Bar chart showing disk usage across hosts.
etc.
